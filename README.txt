	This is out second iteration of out Ecommerce application we implemented the graphical
	user interface.
	Users are able to post a product to sell, buy products, view all the products that are for sale and add
	and finalize purchases through the shopping cart. Purchasing a product will remove
	that product from the product page.
	
	The instructions on using our second iteration of our Ecommerce application called Ezilla is
	staright forward. To run the program the user must run the applicationtester.java file.
	
	We have refactored our code since the first iteration to OOP
	
	** THE CORRECT VERSION FOR ITERATION 2 IS IN ecomm-new-branch NOT main **

	we have yet to add documentation, format our code, and change to descriptive variable names.
	This is our our goal for iteration 3. (not required for iteration 2)
